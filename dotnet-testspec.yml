      # You can switch to an alternate supported version from 1.6.5, 1.7.1, 1.7.2, 1.8.0 , 1.8.1, 1.9.1 by using a command like "avm 1.7.1"
      # OR
      # To install a newer version of Appium use the following commands:
      # - export APPIUM_VERSION=1.8.1
      # - avm $APPIUM_VERSION
      # - ln -s /usr/local/avm/versions/$APPIUM_VERSION/node_modules/.bin/appium  /usr/local/avm/versions/$APPIUM_VERSION/node_modules/appium/bin/appium.js
